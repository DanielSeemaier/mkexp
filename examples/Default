# This is a template for an experiment configuration file.

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1. Define and configure the algorithms that should be included in the 
#    experiment.
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The term "algorithm" refers to a filename in the "partitioners/" subdirectory.
# Each of these files contains instructions to (a) fetch, (b) build and (c) invoke 
# a specific graph partitioner.
#
# New algorithms can be derived by parameterizing these three phases. The semantics 
# of the parameters depend on the algorithm, but are usually passed to (a) git, 
# (b) CMake, (c) the partitioner's binary.

# (a) DefineAlgorithmVersion <new name> <based on> <additional argument>
DefineAlgorithmVersion KaMinPar-DbgBranch KaMinPar origin/my/dbg/branch
# ^ Define a new algorithm "KaMinPar-DbgBranch", based on "KaMinPar", but uses the
# my/dbg/branch branch instead of the main branch.

# (b) DefineAlgorithmBuild <new name> <based on> <additional argument>
DefineAlgorithmBuild KaMinPar64 KaMinPar-DbgBranch -DKAMINPAR_64BIT_IDS=On
# ^ Define a new algorithm "KaMinPar64", based on "KaMinPar-DbgBranch", but passes 
# an additional argument to the CMake script (use 64 bit edge IDs).

# (c) DefineAlgorithm <new name> <based on> <additional argument>
DefineAlgorithm KaMinPar-FM KaMinPar64 -P fm
# ^ Define a new algorithm "KaMinPar-FM", based on "KaMinPar64", but passes the 
# additional flags "-P fm" to the binary.

# For a list of all predefined algorithms, take a look at the "partitioners/" 
# subdirectory. The names of the files correspond to the algorithm names.

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 2. Define the environment of the experiment.
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Pick a system for which the jobfiles should be generated (the names correspond to 
# files in the "systems/" subdirectory):
System Generic
# System i10-Exclusive          # i10 compute servers, run experiment via "exclusive"
# System i10-Nonexclusive       # i10 compute servers, run experiment via "nonexclusive"
# System i10-Parallel           # i10 compute servers, run multiple *sequential* jobs in parallel 
# System i10                    # i10 compute servers, run without exclusive / nonexclusive etc.
# System HoreKa-TBB             # HoreKa with MPI only / MPI+TBB
# System HoreKa-OMP             # HoreKa with MPI only / MPI+OpenMP
# System SuperMUC               # SuperMUC with MPI only / MPI+TBB
# System SuperMUC-SlotScheduler # SuperMUC for shared-memory or sequential jobs, that are executed in parallel on multiple jobs by a job scheduler

# For SuperMUC, provide additional information:
# Username <username>   # your SSH username for SuperMUC file transfer
# Project <project>     # your SuperMUC project

# Load additional libraries (the names correspond to files in the "libs/" subdirectory):
# UseLibrary Sparsehash 

# Select a "call wrapper" that is used to start the partitioners:
Wrapper taskset   # run with taskset to limit CPU affinity
# Wrapper IMPI    # run with Intel MPI 
# Wrapper OpenMPI # run with OpenMPI
# Wrapper none

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 3. Define the experiments.
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Each experiment must be wrapped inside an Experiment*() function block. A single 
# experiment runs one job for each element of the cross product of the following
# parameters:
#
# - included algorithms
# - values for k
# - seeds
# - number of threads (compute nodes, mpi ranks)
# - graphs
#
# Note: there can be multiple Experiment*() blocks in this file.
ExperimentLPvsFM() {
    # Which algorithms should be included?
    Algorithms KaMinPar KaMinPar-FM

    Ks 2 4 8 # partition into 2, 4 and 8 blocks
    Seeds 1 2 3 # perform repetitions with seeds 1, 2 and 3
    Threads 1x1x1 1x1x2 1x1x4 # run with 1, 2 and 4 threads
    #       | | +-- number of threads
    #       | +-- number of MPI processes
    #       +-- number of compute nodes

    # Abort experiment after one hour
    Timelimit 1:00:00 # (optional)

    # Abort one run after 30 minutes 
    TimelimitPerInstance 30:00 # (optional)

    # Partition all graphs contained in some directory
    Graphs /path/to/benchmark/set/

    # Partition a specific graph
    # Graph /path/to/graph/graphfile # note: filename *without* file extension

    # Partition an in-memory graph generated by KaGen:
    #
    # KaGen rgg2d N=10 M=15                  # Random 2D geometric graph with 2^10 vertices and 2^15 edges
    # KaGen rdg2d n=10                       # Random 2D delaunay graph with 10 vertices 
    # KaGen grid2d p=0.5 n=10                # Random 2D grid graph with 10 vertices and 0.5 edge probability
    # KaGen rhg gamma=3.0 N=10 M=15          # Random hyperbolic graph with 2^10 vertices and 2^15 edges
    # KaGen rmat a=0.1 b=0.2 c=0.3 N=10 M=15 # Random R-MAT graph with 2^10 vertices, 2^15 edges and probabilities 0.1/0.2/0.3/0.4
    #
    # Note: KaGen support is only available for some of the predefined partitioners.
    #
    # Note: to perform weak scaling experiments, the variables provided to KaGen can be scaled 
    # the following values, where $lN = log2($N) etc:
    # - $N, $lN: number of compute nodes 
    # - $M, $lM: number of MPI processes
    # - $T, $lT: number of threads
    # - $P, $lP: number of PEs = $N * $M * $T
    #
    # E.g., to generate a RGG2D graph with 2^26 vertices *per compute node* and 2^29 edges *per compute node*, use:
    # KaGen rgg2d 'N=$((26+$lN))' 'M=$((29+$lN))'
    #
    # It is crucial to surround the variables with upticks ('), as otherwise Bash would attempt to evaluate the expression immediately.
